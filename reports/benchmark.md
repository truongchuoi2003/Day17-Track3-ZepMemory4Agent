`<USER_SUMMARY> For the company project BLUEBIRD-42, the backend must use TypeScript with NestJS. Minh prefers Python for personal demos like ORCHID-27. The user's personal project is named ORCHID-27. The user needs to complete a benchmark report by Friday at 16:00, which is an open loop LAB-REPORT-1600. The user is currently debugging async HTTP and attempted to increase the timeout to 60 seconds, but it still failed. The user asked to check the connection pool, client lifecycle, and concurrency. The effective solution was to reuse the aiohttp ClientSession and set concurrency to 20. The main issue was connection churn, not the timeout threshold. This incident is referred to as ASYNC-FIX-20.`
